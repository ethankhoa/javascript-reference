# What is Fetch???? -_-

Fetch is an API which provides a logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network using Promises, which enables a simpler and cleaner API, avoiding callback hell and having to remember the complex API of XMLHttpRequest.

The aim of fetch is to provide a modern equivalent to XMLHttpRequest which is an API that gives you the functionality for transferring data between a client and a server. It offers the same sort of functionality but is designed to be more efficient and easier to use.

# Why would I use Fetch?

Many websites/apps need to load resources from a remote URL. You may want to make a POST request to a REST API, or you may simply need to fetch a chunk of static content from another server.

The Fetch request is a standard which provides a unified architecture for API interfaces so they are all consistent when it comes to various aspects of fetching, such as redirects and the CORS(cross-origin HTTP request) protocol. This is basically a fancy way of saying to request a resource from a domain or port which is different from the first resource itself serves.

The Fetch Standard also defines the fetch() JavaScript API, which exposes most of the networking functionality at a fairly low level of abstraction.

# How to implement a fetch() request

In order to fetch content from an arbitrary URL, just pass the URL to fetch:
``` javascript
fetch('https://mywebsite.com/mydata.json')
```
Fetch also takes an optional second argument that allows you to customize the HTTP request. You may want to specify additional headers, or make a POST request:
``` javascript
fetch('https://mywebsite.com/endpoint/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    firstParam: 'yourValue',
    secondParam: 'yourOtherValue',
  })
})
```

# What are some potential downfalls of using Fetch?

The technologies specification has not stabilized, and the level of compatability for using in various browsers differ, especially around it's use in IE. 

# What's missing?
Of course, there are some features XHR has that fetch doesn't have.

### Request aborting
This is the big one, there's no way to abort a request before headers have arrived.

There are plans to fix this using cancellable promises, but will be part of further iterations down the track.

### Progress events
Progress events are a high level feature that won't arrive in fetch for now. You can create your own by looking at the Content-Length header and using a pass-through stream to monitor the bytes received.

This means you can explicitly handle responses without a Content-Length differently. And of course, even if Content-Length is there it can be a lie. With streams you can handle these lies however you want.

### Synchronous requests
Noooope. The fetch spec documents them, but they won't be part of the API. Sync requests are awful.
